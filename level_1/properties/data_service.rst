Data Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data services are resources that provide access to data or analytical tools via some interface. The interface may be machine-readable (I.e., an Application Programming Interface – API) or via a Web page for humans to interact manually. There are different conventions for data services on the VP Portal, depending on the “nature” of the service. Resources that serve via a Web page, **must have** a landingPage property, while those that serve via an API **must have** both an endpointURL and endpointDescription. On the EJP VP, a service that serves a DCAT Dataset **must be** connected to a DCAT Distribution of that Dataset via the dcat:accessService property. A service not serving a dataset (e.g., a statistical analysis service, or an ontology lookup service) **must be** connected to the top-level DCAT Catalog via the dcat:service property.

	* - **Type**
	  - In the context of ERDERA Data Services, if the service is a Beacon, the range is either http://purl.org/ejp-rd/vocabulary/VPBeacon2_individuals or http://purl.org/ejp-rd/vocabulary/VPBeacon2_catalog. If the service is anything besides a Beacon, use one of the children of `edam_operation <http://edamontology.org/operation_0004>`_.
	  - | dcterms:type
	* - **Title**
	  - The name of the data service. This is a required field and needs to be unique.

	  - | ejprd:personalData
	* - **Theme**
	  - Points to an URL that specifies relevant ontology concepts that classify the data service. Typically, these can be looked up using the `Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index>`_ or Bioportal. Note that the purpose of 'Theme' is todescribe the service for the purpose of discovery, which is distinct from the purpose of classification of the service, which is served by 'Type'.

	  - Pointer to a Contact Point, Range is vCard
	  - | dcat:contactPoint 
	* - **Language**
	  - An ISO 639-1 two-letter code for the languages this data service is provided in. Example: en indicates that this data service is available in English. The range is an xsd:string. The ISO language codes can be found at: `ISO639-1 <https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1.html>`_ and `an example <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en>`_.
