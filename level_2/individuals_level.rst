Content-Based Discovery at /individuals Level
------------

This allows querying based on safe versions of individual records within the resource's data. This "record-level" querying takes is powerful, in that enables researchers to extract valuable insights from resources without compromising data privacy. Indeed, if this capability is implemented via certain of the EJP RD solutions (RD-Nexus, Molgenis) a resource can optionally extend the scope and power of their discovery services to enable private networks, specialised permissions for users, and even full record discovery in other projects should they wish to do so. In the EJP RD setting, we only query content as per the EJP RD Beacon v2 API specification, and the resource has the option of responding only if the user has been authenticated (logged in) via the VP. The queried content is based on the recommended CDEs and discussions with several rare disease partners. The following table shows an overview of the filters used at the record level, as defined in the EJP RD VP API Specification [`link <https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/vp-api-specs>`_]. This endpoint is most suitable for querying individual registries, biobanks and knowledge bases (i.e., resources with data about entities such as patients, biosamples, cell lines, etc).

The filters shown in the table below can be applied to a query to only show certain results.
